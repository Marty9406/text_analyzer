# Text analyzer
<b>First project at Engeto Python Academy.</b>

It's a simple code that lets a user choose from three texts (more texts can 
be added), analyzes selected text and prints:
 - the total number of words
 - the number of titlecase words
 - the number of uppercase words
 - the number of lowercase words
 - the number of numeric strings
 - the sum of all numbers
 - simple bar chart with the frequency of individual word lengths
